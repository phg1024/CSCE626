Parallel prefix sum in MPI and OpenMP
**************************************

List of files
==================

setup_env.sh This file is used to setup the environment to compile and run MPI and
             OpenMP programs on Eos. Make sure you execute the following command
             from your current shell
             $ source <path to setup_env.sh> setup_env.sh
             before you try to compile/run. A good practice is to place the above
             line in your ~/.bashrc

prefixsum_mpi.cpp: MPI implementation for parallel prefix sum. Uses explicit MPI calls for communication.

prefixsum_openmp.cpp: OpenMP implementation for parallel prefix sum.

Makefile: File for compilation of the code files and clean up of the executables.

Compiling on Eos
==================
$ make

This will generate 2 executable prefixsum_mpi and prefixsum_openmp.

Running Interactively on Eos
============================
The processor limit for running jobs interactively (i.e. directly through the shell)
is 4. Therefore, for interactive test runs (for both MPI and OpenMP programs), please
do not exceed the concurrent use of more that 4 processors.

More information can be found on:
http://sc.tamu.edu/help/eos/login.php

For running programs with larger number of processors, you will need to use the batch
processing system. More information about batch processing can be found at:
http://sc.tamu.edu/help/eos/batch/


Running MPI on Eos
====================

$ mpirun -np 2 prefixsum_mpi 32000 100

This runs "prefixsum_mpi" on 2 mpi processes to compute prefix sums of 32000 ints. It runs 100 iterations. This run does not output the input array nor the prefix sums.

$ mpirun -np 16 prefixsum_mpi 1000000 32 -o

This runs "prefixsum_mpi" on 16 mpi processes to compute prefix sums of 1000000 ints. It runs 32 iterations. This run outputs the input array and the prefix sums to screen. To redirect the output to a file, use > operator.


Running OpenMP on Eos
=======================
$ ./prefixsum_openmp 4 32000 100

This runs "prefixsum_openmp" on 4 threads to compute prefix sums of 32000 ints. It runs 100 iterations. This run does not output the input array nor the prefix sums.


$ ./prefixsum_openmp 8 1000000 32 -o

This runs "prefixsum_openmp" on 8 threads to compute prefix sums of 1000000 ints. It runs 32 iterations. This run outputs the input array and the prefix sums to screen. To redirect the output to a file, use > operator.
Cleanup
=======
$ make clean
